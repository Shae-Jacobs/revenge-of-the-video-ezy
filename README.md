# Revenge of the video ezy
## 2 day project
Every Friday, I collaborate with 3â€“5 classmates on a short-term project. Teams are announced on Thursdays, allowing me to work with different peers each week and tackle new challenges. This repository showcases one of the projects I am proud to have worked on.
## Planning 
On Thursday, my group and I created a plan using Miro, which included wireframes, database diagrams, a daily schedule, and much more. Click [here](https://github.com/Shae-Jacobs/revenge-of-the-video-ezy/tree/main/public/images/Planning) to see more about our planning.
## User Story 
As a user, I want to view a list of movies along with their genres, so I can explore different types of films. I also want the ability to review each movie by providing a rating, so I can share my opinion and see what others think.
